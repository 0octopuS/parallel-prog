# Work Sharing

- Parallel region creates an "Single Program Multiple Data" instance where
  each thread executes the same code
- How can one split the work between the threads in a parallel region?
    - Loop construct
    - Single/Master construct
    - Sections construct
    - Task construct
    - Workshare construct (Fortran only)


# Loop construct

- Directive instructing compiler to share the work of a loop
    - C/C++:  `#pragma omp for [clauses]`
    - Fortran: `!$omp do [clauses]`
    - The construct must be followed by a loop construct
        - in C/C++ limited only to for-loops
    - It must reside inside a parallel region
        - Combined construct with omp parallel:\
          `#pragma omp parallel for / !$omp parallel do`
- The loop index is private by default
- Work sharing can be adjusted with the schedule clause



# Loop construct

```fortran
!$omp parallel shared(x,y,z) private(i)
!$omp do
  do i = 1, n
     z(i) = x(i) + y(i)
  end do
!$omp end do
!$omp end parallel
```

```c
#pragma omp parallel shared(x,y,z) private(i)
{
    #pragma omp for
    for (i=0; i < n; i++)
        z[i] = x[i] + y[i];
}
```
- Only for-loops with a "canonical" form can be used in C/C++. Iterator base
  loops are also possible in C++


# Loop scheduling clause

`schedule(static[,chunk])`
  : Blocks of iterations of size chunk for each thread

`schedule(dynamic[,chunk])`
  : Chunk iterations off a queue until everything is done

`schedule(guided[,chunk])`
  : Threads grab blocks of iterations, size of blocks starts from larger size
    and shrinks down to chunk

`schedule(runtime)`
  : Schedule and chunk size are taken from environment variable
    `OMP_SCHEDULE`


# Loop scheduling clause

```c
int kernel(int w, int h, complex dc, int x, int y) {
    float fx = (float) x / w;
    float fy = (float) y / h;
    complex c = cmin + fx * creal(dc) + fy * cimag(dc) * I;
    int iteration = 0;
    complex z = c;
    while(iteration < MAX_ITER_COUNT && abs2(z) < 2 * 2) {
        z = z * z + c;
        iteration++;
    }
    return iteration;
}
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(guided)
for (int i=0; i < Nx; i++) {
    for (int j=y0; j < Ny; j++) {
        iter_counts[j * w + i] = kernel(w, h, cmax - cmin, i, j);
    }
}
```


# Lastprivate data-sharing clause

`lastprivate(list)`
  : Private variable where the original  variable is updated with the value
    from the "last" parallel _iteration step_ or _section_

```c
int n = 10;
int a, b, i;
#pragma omp parallel for private(i,a) lastprivate(b)
for (i=0; i < n; i++) {
    a = i;
    b = i;
}
printf("private int is %d, lastprivate int is %d\n", a, b);
```
```bash
./test
private int is 32765, lastprivate int is 9
```


# Workshare directive (Fortran only)

- The workshare directive divides the execution of the enclosed structured
  block into separate units of work, each of which is executed only once
    - Array assignments, forall and where statements etc.

```fortran
real :: a(n,n), b(n,n), c(n,n) d(n,n)
...
!$omp parallel shared(a,b,c,d)
  !$omp workshare
     c = a * b
     d = a + b
  !$omp end workshare
!$omp end parallel
```

- Note that performance may be bad in some compilers, in particular with Intel


# Summary

- Work sharing construct distribute work between threads
- Parallel do/for loops
    - Remember the restrictions on loop construct (C/C++)
    - Scheduling can be adjusted
